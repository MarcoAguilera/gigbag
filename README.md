# What is gigbag?
Gigbag is a booking solution for both musicians and people looking to hire Regional Mexican groups. Currently, most groups are getting their gigs from word of mouth and social media platforms. The goal is to create a booking tool that helps groups manage their gigs and inquires more effectively. As for the people looking to hire a group for their next occasion, gigbag would provide a plethora of options for groups that fall under the Regional Mexican umbrella.
